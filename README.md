# Plants-Seedling-Classification
## Course: Introduction to Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This repository contains the project for the course 'Introduction to Computer Vision', part of the 'Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications'.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to efficiently classify different plant seedlings and weeds. The classifier aims to improve crop yields by accurately identifying various plant species, thereby minimizing the need for human involvement in the process.
